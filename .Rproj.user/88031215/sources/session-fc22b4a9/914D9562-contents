# Purpose

Setup of GitHub to check code and graphs


```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

Regression table for the pooled OLS of the dataset

```{r, results = 'asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Pool <- Pooled_OLS()
Pool
```

Regression table for a two way fixed effects model

```{r, results = 'asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Two_Way <- Two_Way_Fix_Eff()
Two_Way
```
