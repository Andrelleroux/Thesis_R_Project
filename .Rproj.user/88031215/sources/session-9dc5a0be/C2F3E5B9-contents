## GDP Prediction using Backpropagation

In this model, the GDP of a specific country is predicted based on the GDP of other countries, excluding the country's own GDP. The prediction for country \(i\) at time \(t\) is denoted as \(\hat{GDP}_i(t)\), and the inputs consist of the GDPs of other countries.

The model computes the prediction as follows:

\[
\hat{GDP}_i(t) = f\left( \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{n} w_{ij} \cdot GDP_j(t-1) + b_i \right)
\]

Where:
- \(w_{ij}\) represents the weight assigned to the GDP of country \(j\) for predicting country \(i\)'s GDP.
- \(b_i\) is the bias term for country \(i\).
- \(f(\cdot)\) is the activation function, specifically the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), defined as:

\[
f(x) = \max(0, x)
\]

### Backpropagation

To minimize the error in predictions, we update the weights \(w_{ij}\) and biases \(b_i\) using backpropagation. The error \(E\) at each iteration is calculated as:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \left( \hat{GDP}_i(t) - GDP_i(t) \right)^2
\]

The weight update rule using gradient descent is:

\[
w_{ij}^{(new)} = w_{ij}^{(old)} - \eta \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{ij}}
\]

Similarly, the bias update rule is:

\[
b_i^{(new)} = b_i^{(old)} - \eta \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_i}
\]

Where \(\eta\) is the learning rate.

By iterating through multiple training epochs, the model adjusts the weights and biases to minimize the prediction error.

The weight matrix \( W \) is a square matrix of dimension \( n \times n \), where \( n \) is the number of countries. Each element \( w_{ij} \) in the matrix represents the weight assigned to the GDP of country \( j \) when predicting the GDP of country \( i \). Since a country's own GDP is not used to predict itself, the diagonal elements of the matrix are set to zero:

\[
W = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & w_{12} & w_{13} & \dots & w_{1n} \\
w_{21} & 0 & w_{23} & \dots & w_{2n} \\
w_{31} & w_{32} & 0 & \dots & w_{3n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
w_{n1} & w_{n2} & w_{n3} & \dots & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This matrix \( W \) satisfies the following condition:

\[
w_{ii} = 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \dots, n
\]

Where:
- \( w_{ij} \) denotes the weight connecting the GDP of country \( j \) to the prediction of country \( i \)'s GDP.
- \( n \) is the total number of countries.
